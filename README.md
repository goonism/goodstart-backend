# Goodstart Backend
This is the code for Goodstart which is a Chrome New Tab page meant to get you to start your day right. This is a series of hacks we want to do to spread positivity throughout the internet. To see the Github repo for the Chrome Extension code, go [here!](https://github.com/goonism/goodstart). Thanks, have an amazing day!

## Running Backend
`node index.js <positive message> <background color>`

Substitute positive message and background color for the positive message and background color you want to have being represented.

## Changing the message
This is super janky and will be improved some day when I have time. Basically to change the message, run the bash script `createNewMessage.sh` like so:
`./createNewMessage.sh <your ssh server> <location of config file in remote host>`
